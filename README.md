# Hey you 🫵 Welcome!

## Quick presentation

- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdlarX9
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithmic using mathematical concepts and full stack web developement.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a full stack web application involving many technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff that I know, honestly i'm doing my own business for the moment.
- 📫 You can reach me on Instagram
- ⚡ Fun fact: ADLAR was my first pick as a pseudo, but I added "x9" after it so the username wouldn't have already been taken (only on GitHub).


## Overview of my coding journey

I first took contact with coding in 2021, that was mainly python but I didn't understand it much (I made like 3 programs that had no sense at all).

It all really started in August 2023 by HTML and CSS. Then I moved to JavaScript and learnt some frontend libraries such as THREE.js or GSAP.
After that, I tried Express and Socket.IO to make APIs, but I realized PHP was better.

I took a "break" in web developement to focus on my 3D engine in C++.

I'm currently working on a social network/game using React, framer motion, Redux, TanStack Query and Axios for the frontend. While using Symfony 7, Mercure, Redis, PeerJS for the backend as services in Docker Compose, the entire project is behind a reverse proxy Nginx.
You can find this project on my repository AdlarX9/Project-P.

As a side project, I'm working on a reproduction of the Spot robot from Boston Dynamics. This project consists of making a 3D and physics engines, and an AI for the dog robot to learn how to walk and run.

In the future, I will probably remake my portfolio because I find it simple and not impressive.

## Other activities

I draw all kind of things, you can find them on my website or on Instagram. \
I also 3D print stuff life size and then paint them, I didn't posted any of my creations yet but that wouldn't last... \
I am also in High School, so I spend most of my time sat on a chair listening to a teacher 👨‍🏫 or asleep 🛌.
