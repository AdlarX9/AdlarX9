# Hey you 🫵 Welcome !




## Quick presentation

- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdlarX9
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithmic using mathematic concepts and full stack web developement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Redis stream, Symfony Messenger and machine learning concepts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff that I know, honestly i'm doing my own stuff for the moment.
- 📫 You can reach me on Instagram
- ⚡ Fun fact: ADLAR was my first choice as a pseudo, but I added "x9" after it so the username wouldn't have already been taken.



## Overview of my coding journey

I first took contact with coding in 2021, that was mainly python but I didn't understand it much.

It all really started in August 2023 by HTML and CSS. Then I moved to JavaScript and learnt some frontend libraries such as THREE.js or GSAP.
After that, I tried Express and Socket.IO to make APIs, but I realized PHP was better.

I took a "break" in web developement to focus on my 3D engine in C++.

I'm currently working on a social network/game using React, framer motion, Redux, TanStack Query and Axios for the frontend. While using Symfony 7, Mercure and Redis stream for the API



## Other activities

I draw all kind of things, you can find them on my website or on Instagram.

I also 3D print stuff life size and then paint them, I didn't posted any of my creations yet but that wouldn't last...

I am also in High School, so I spent most of my time sat on a chair listening to a teacher 👨‍🏫 or sleeping 🛌
