# Hey you 🫵 Welcome!

## Who am I?

- 👋 Hi, I’m **@AdlarX9**.
- 🧠 My passion lies in **algorithmics**, driven by deep **mathematical concepts**, and I’m constantly diving into the world of **full-stack web development**.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m building a **full-stack web application** that pushes the limits of modern technologies.
- 💡 I’m always open to collaborating on exciting projects, but right now, I’m focused on building my own ventures.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on **Instagram** — let's connect!
- ⚡ Fun fact: **ADLAR** was my first chosen username, but to ensure I didn’t face the dreaded "username taken" dilemma, I added "**x9**". That’s how you get the unique handle you see today.

## My Coding Journey — From Curious to Creating

I first dipped my toes into the coding world back in 2021, mainly with **Python**. Let’s be honest, my early projects didn’t make much sense (just a couple of odd programs I still can't explain...).

Things really took off in **August 2023** when I started learning **HTML** and **CSS**. From there, I ventured into **JavaScript** and explored various frontend libraries like **THREE.js** and **GSAP**.
 
Later, I experimented with **Express** and **Socket.IO** to build APIs but quickly found that **PHP** suited my needs better. 

After a brief "break" to focus on a **C++ 3D engine**, I’m now fully immersed in building a **social network/game**. The tech stack includes **React**, **Framer Motion**, **Redux**, **TanStack Query**, and **Axios** on the frontend, with a **Symfony 7**, **Mercure**, **Redis**, and **PeerJS** backend running smoothly in **Docker Compose** behind an **Nginx reverse proxy**.
You can check this out on **[AdlarX9/project-p](https://github.com/AdlarX9/project-p)**.

I’m also working on a **Spot robot** simulation, inspired by **Boston Dynamics**. It’s a challenging but fascinating project involving a 3D engine, physics engine, and AI that helps the robot learn how to walk and run.

I also plan to revamp my portfolio soon. While it gets the job done, I think it’s time to make it more impressive!

## Beyond Code — My Other Passions

I’m also into **drawing** — I create all sorts of artwork, which you can check out on my website or [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/alexis_lrse/). 🎨

When I'm not coding or sketching, I enjoy **3D printing life-size models** and then **painting** them. While I haven’t posted any of my creations yet, I have plenty of exciting work to share soon! 🖨️🎨

By the way, I’m still in **high school**, so I spend most of my time **sat** on a chair or asleep! 🛌👨‍🏫
