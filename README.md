# Hey you 🫵 Welcome !



## Quick presentation

- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdlarX9
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithmic using mathematical concepts and full stack web developement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Redis stream, Symfony Messenger and machine learning basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff that I know, honestly i'm doing my own stuff for the moment.
- 📫 You can reach me on Instagram
- ⚡ Fun fact: ADLAR was my first choice as a pseudo, but I added "x9" after it so the username wouldn't have already been taken.


## Overview of my coding journey

I first took contact with coding in 2021, that was mainly python but I didn't understand it much.

It all really started in August 2023 by HTML and CSS. Then I moved to JavaScript and learnt some frontend libraries such as THREE.js or GSAP.
After that, I tried Express and Socket.IO to make APIs, but I realized PHP was better.

I took a "break" in web developement to focus on my 3D engine in C++.

I'm currently working on a social network/game using React, framer motion, Redux, TanStack Query and Axios for the frontend. While using Symfony 7, Mercure and Redis stream for the API.
You can find this project on my repositories AdlarX9/Project-P_frontend and AdlarX9/Project-P_backend.

In the future, I will remake my portfolio because I find it a bit simple and not impressing. And I think I'm gonna make a real time 3D engine or a neuronal system just to change from websites.
And maybe I'm gonna take a month or two to learn the basics of the most famous programming laguages such as Go, Rust, C#, Swift, Java, Ruby and so on (that's quite a lot here, I'll see what's the most interesting for me).


## Other activities

I draw all kind of things, you can find them on my website or on Instagram.

I also 3D print stuff life size and then paint them, I didn't posted any of my creations yet but that wouldn't last...

I am also in High School, so I spend most of my time sat on a chair listening to a teacher 👨‍🏫 or sleeping 🛌
