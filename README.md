# Hey you 🫵 Welcome!

## Who am I?

- 👋 Hi, I’m **@AdlarX9**.
- 🧠 My passion lies in **algorithmics**, driven by deep **mathematical concepts**, and I’m constantly diving into the world of **code**.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m not building a Netflix clone. It's Nitflex and it consists of watching locally hosted films and series.
- 💡 I’m always open to collaborate on exciting projects.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on **Instagram** — let's connect!
- ⚡ Fun fact: **ADLAR** was my first chosen username, but to ensure I didn’t face the dreaded "username taken" dilemma, I added "**x9**". That’s how you get the unique handle you see today.

## My Coding Journey

I first dipped my toes into the coding world back in 2021, mainly with **Python**. Let’s be honest, my early projects didn’t make much sense.

Things really took off in **August 2023** when I started learning **HTML** and **CSS**. From there, I ventured into **JavaScript** and explored various frontend libraries like **THREE.js** and **GSAP**.
 
Later, I experimented with **Express** and **Socket.IO** to build APIs but quickly found that **PHP** suited my needs better. 

After a brief “break” to focus on a **C++ 3D engine**, I came back to JavaScript and React to build this awesome project I called **Project P**.  
I built it while I was working on a team project for the [Trophées NSI](https://trophees-nsi.fr). We stood out by winning the national prize “Prix du Meilleur Projet 1ère” (Best Project, 11th grade).  
**Bletchley’s Adventure** was the game we made. Our team consisted of [Equinoxs](https://github.com/Equinoxs), [Poshou](https://github.com/Popashoubi), [Dim Bananox](https://github.com/Dim-Bananox) and I.

I also built another 3D engine, this time with OpenGL to learn the library. I later upgraded it into a physics simulator (I named it **Empire**).

I’m currently working on a macOS app to watch the films I’ve bought and stored on my computer as if it were a great streaming service.

I plan to revamp my portfolio soon. While it gets the job done, I think I can make this a bit more impressive.

## Beyond Code — My Other Passions

I’m also into **drawing** — I create all sorts of artwork, which you can check out on my website or [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/alexis_lrse/). 🎨

When I'm not coding or sketching, I enjoy **3D printing life-size models** and then **painting** them. While I haven’t posted any of my creations yet, I have plenty of exciting work to share soon! 🖨️ 🎨

I'm hooping from times to times (playing street basketball). FYI, I'm 1m93 or 6'4" so that helps :)

By the way, I’m still in **high school**, so I spend most of my time **sat** on a chair listening to a teacher or asleep! 🛌 👨‍🏫
